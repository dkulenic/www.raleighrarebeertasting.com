This beer is not fermented in a stainless tank and doesn't use brewer’s yeast at all - only the wild yeast and bacteria strains in our HTW culture.  Fermentation in the barrel takes up to 6 months.  Final ABV is estimated (we haven't tested it yet) to be 10.5%.  It's also bracingly sour with a pH of around 3.3.  Very cool purple/burgundy color."
